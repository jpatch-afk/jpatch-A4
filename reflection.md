- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


My inital impressions of 'Encapsulation' affecting my programming is that it makes it more effective, however there are a lot of moving parts that make it work that I do not quite understand yet. It takes less lines of code to do the same function, which is helpful, but still confusing. 

What worked was creating all of the methods and foundation of the program with the detailed instructions. What didn't worked was having the methods cross between files. I looked it up and trialed and errored to no avail. I'll work on it later when I have more time and ask. 

The advice I would give is that this train is more complicated than it looks: don't be afraid to ask for help.
